# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Risko â€“ Know the risks of disasters near you.

**Risko** is an iOS mobile app designed to help French people learn about and better prepare for emergencies and disasters. Initially developed during the [NotJustDev Hackathon](https://www.notjusthack.com) , the app combines reliable public data from the French government's [GÃ©orisques API](https://www.georisks.gouv.fr/doc-api#/) with a touch of AI [Deep Infra](https://deepinfra.com) to provide relevant information in real time.
